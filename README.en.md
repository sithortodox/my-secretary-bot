# 🤖 telegram-autopilot — cloud

A personal AI assistant built into your Telegram profile.  
It reads incoming messages and replies on your behalf — when you're busy, on the go, or just want to delegate routine conversations.

Connects via the official Telegram **Chat Automation** feature — no grey-area workarounds, only the official Bot API.

## 👑 Owner Panel

The `/owneradmin` command — only for `OWNER_ID`:

- **Stats** — onboarding funnel, subscriptions by plan, growth
- **Activity** — DAU/WAU/MAU, messages per day, LLM errors, model usage
- **Finance** — Stars earned, Stars→USD, transactions by plan
- **Users** — paginated user list
- **Database** — export `.db.gz`
- **Cleanup** — delete events older than 30/90 days

```
/banuser ID      — ban a user
/unbanuser ID    — unban a user
/deleteuser ID   — delete all user data
```

---

## 🧠 How Context Works

Every LLM request contains three blocks:

```
=== ASSISTANT ROLE ===
AI assistant embedded in a Telegram profile...

=== ABOUT THE PROFILE OWNER ===
[system prompt configured by the user]

=== WHO IS WRITING NOW ===
Name: ...  Username: @...
[user note + AI note if available]
[first message / message #N]
```

### Automatic Notes

After each message, a background task analyses the conversation. If it learns something new about the contact — it updates the note automatically. Users can also add their own note separately.
